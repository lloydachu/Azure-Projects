Configuring a SharePoint file, such as a fillable PDF form, to meet your requirements involves a combination of SharePoint permissions management, PDF form design, and workflow configurations to ensure the form can be reused securely without exposing sensitive data. Here’s how to achieve this:
Step 1: Set Up the Fillable PDF

    Create a Template PDF Form:
        Use Adobe Acrobat or similar software to design the fillable form.
        Ensure the form fields are set to clear/reset upon save to avoid retaining user input.

    Disable Save Field Data:
        Configure the form to disallow saving filled-out data by enabling only print or download options.
        In Adobe Acrobat:
            Go to File > Properties > Security tab.
            Choose Restrict Editing or set the file as Read Only.

    Save as a Secure Template:
        Save the form and ensure it is locked to prevent editing of the original template.

Step 2: Upload the Template to SharePoint

    Create a Document Library:
        Create a dedicated document library in SharePoint to store the template.
        For example: "Reusable Forms Library."

    Upload the Form:
        Upload the PDF template to this library.

Step 3: Configure SharePoint Permissions

    Restrict User Access to the Template:
        Navigate to the document library.
        Select the template file > Manage Access > Advanced Permissions Settings.
        Break permission inheritance for this library by clicking Stop Inheriting Permissions.

    Grant Users View-Only Access:
        Assign users Read-Only or View Only access to the template file:
            Read-Only: Users can view and download but cannot edit the template.
            View Only: Users can only view the template in the browser and cannot download or print.

    Allow Download for Individual Forms:
        To enable users to download only their completed forms, use a separate folder or library where they can upload and manage their completed forms.

Step 4: Automate the Workflow

    Use Power Automate (Optional):
        Automate workflows to reset or clean up the template after use:
            Set up a Power Automate flow to move completed forms to another library or delete them after download.
        Example: Trigger the workflow when a file is uploaded to the Completed Forms Library.

    Prevent Data Overwriting:
        If users upload their filled forms to SharePoint, ensure files have unique names by appending a timestamp or user identifier.

Step 5: Educate Users on Form Usage

    Instructions for Users:
        Inform users to:
            Download the template form.
            Fill it out locally.
            Save it as a new file (with a unique name).
            Upload their completed form (if required).
    Train on Secure Handling:
        Ensure users understand they should not modify the original template.

Step 6: Test the Setup

    Perform the following checks:
        Users can access the template and fill it out.
        Completed forms are not saved in a way that exposes previous users’ data.
        The original template remains unchanged and secure.

Optional Enhancements

    Protect the Original Template:
        Use Information Rights Management (IRM) in SharePoint to prevent unauthorized actions like copying or downloading.
    Use Separate Libraries:
        Keep the template in a secure library and allow users to work with their completed forms in a different library.

By following these steps, you ensure that users can safely fill out and download the form without exposing sensitive information, while keeping the template secure and reusable.
